━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎉 WHAT WAS FIXED:

The frontend was hardcoded to always show "Demo Mode Active"
even when AI services were running!

Now it actually checks if services are available and shows
the correct status.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ CURRENT STATUS:

Backend:
  ✅ AI services running (ports 5001, 5002)
  ✅ Health endpoint working
  ✅ Routes registered
  ✅ Can reach AI services

Frontend:
  ✅ Health check added
  ✅ Dynamic status display
  ✅ Correct button text
  ✅ No TypeScript errors

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🚀 TO TEST RIGHT NOW:

1. Make sure AI services are running:
   
   cd G:\RADIOLOGY\redio-test\ai-services
   curl http://localhost:5001/health
   curl http://localhost:5002/health
   
   If not running:
   .\start-ai-services.bat

2. Restart your frontend (if running):
   
   cd G:\RADIOLOGY\redio-test\viewer
   # Press Ctrl+C to stop
   npm run dev

3. Open browser and test:
   
   http://localhost:5173
   → Login
   → Open a study
   → Click "AI Analysis" tab
   → Should see: "✅ AI Services Available"
   → Click "Run AI Analysis"
   → See real AI results!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📊 WHAT YOU'LL SEE:

BEFORE (Wrong):
  ⚠️  Demo Mode Active
  AI services not running
  [Run Demo AI Analysis]

AFTER (Correct):
  ✅ AI Services Available
  MedSigLIP and MedGemma ready
  [Run AI Analysis]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 VERIFICATION:

✅ AI services running
✅ Backend can reach services
✅ Frontend health check added
✅ UI updated
✅ No TypeScript errors
✅ Ready to test!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📁 FILES MODIFIED:

viewer/src/components/ai/AIAnalysisPanel.tsx
  - Added health check on mount
  - Added servicesAvailable state
  - Updated UI to show actual status
  - Changed button text dynamically

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎉 IT SHOULD WORK NOW!

Just restart your frontend and test it.
