# ‚úÖ CORS Issue Fixed!

## Problem

The error you saw:
```
localhost:3010 says
AI analysis failed: Failed to fetch

Make sure AI services are running:
- MedSigLIP: http://localhost:5001
- MedGemma: http://localhost:5002
```

This was a **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** error. Your frontend on `localhost:3010` couldn't access the AI services on `localhost:5001` and `localhost:5002` because the Flask servers didn't allow cross-origin requests.

## Solution

I added CORS support to both AI services:

### 1. Installed flask-cors
```bash
pip install flask-cors
```

### 2. Updated Both Servers

**medsigclip_server.py**:
```python
from flask_cors import CORS

app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)  # Enable CORS for all routes
```

**medgemma_server.py**:
```python
from flask_cors import CORS

app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)  # Enable CORS for all routes
```

### 3. Restarted Services

Both services are now running with CORS enabled.

## Status

‚úÖ **MedSigLIP**: Running on port 5001 with CORS
‚úÖ **MedGemma**: Running on port 5002 with CORS
‚úÖ **CORS Headers**: Enabled for all origins
‚úÖ **Ready to test**: Refresh your browser and try again!

## How to Test

1. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl+R or F5)

2. **Open a study in the viewer**

3. **Click the AI Assistant button** (robot icon)

4. **Click "Analyze Current Frame"**

5. **Should work now!** ‚úÖ

## What Changed

**Before**:
```
Browser (localhost:3010) ‚Üí AI Service (localhost:5001)
‚ùå BLOCKED by CORS policy
```

**After**:
```
Browser (localhost:3010) ‚Üí AI Service (localhost:5001)
‚úÖ ALLOWED with CORS headers
```

## Verification

Test the services:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5001/health
curl http://localhost:5002/health
```

Both should return:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "model": "...",
  "demo_mode": true
}
```

## Files Modified

- `ai-services/medsigclip_server.py` - Added CORS
- `ai-services/medgemma_server.py` - Added CORS
- `ai-services/requirements.txt` - Added flask-cors

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Services restarted with CORS
2. ‚úÖ Ready to test
3. üîÑ **Refresh your browser**
4. üéØ **Try "Analyze Current Frame" again**

It should work perfectly now! üöÄ
