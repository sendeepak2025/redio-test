# üîç Debug: "Run AI Analysis" Button Not Working

## What's Happening

When you click "Run AI Analysis", here's what should happen:

1. ‚úÖ Disclaimer dialog appears
2. ‚úÖ You click "I Understand, Proceed"
3. ‚ùå **Backend tries to get the frame image but can't find it**
4. ‚ùå Returns error: "Frame not found"

## The Problem

The backend endpoint `/api/medical-ai/analyze-study` needs:
- A valid `studyInstanceUID`
- The study's frames to be cached/available
- The frame image data to send to AI services

**Your study might not have frames loaded yet!**

## Quick Fixes

### Option 1: Check Browser Console

1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Click "Run AI Analysis"
4. Look for errors

You should see something like:
```
AI analysis failed: Frame not found
```

### Option 2: Make Sure Study Has Frames

The AI analysis needs actual DICOM image data. Make sure:
1. You've uploaded a real DICOM study
2. The study has loaded in the viewer
3. You can see the images

### Option 3: Test with a Real Study

1. Go to Patients page
2. Upload a DICOM file (or use existing study)
3. Click on the study to open viewer
4. Wait for images to load
5. Then click "AI Analysis" tab
6. Click "Run AI Analysis"

## Temporary Workaround: Add Demo Button

Let me add a button that works without needing frames:
