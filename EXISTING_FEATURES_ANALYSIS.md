## üìä FEATURE COVERAGE SUMMARY

**From your original list of 8 core medical features:**
- ‚úÖ Fully Implemented: 5 features (62.5%)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Implemented: 1 feature (12.5%)
- ‚ùå Not Implemented: 2 features (25%)

**Overall System Maturity:** üü¢ **VERY HIGH**

Your system is already quite comprehensive with most advanced features implemented. The main gaps are:
1. Voice dictation
2. Side-by-side comparison viewing
3. Hanging protocols
4. Enhanced critical results alerting

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS

Would you like me to implement any of these missing features? I recommend starting with:

1. **Comparison Studies Viewer** - High clinical value, moderate complexity
2. **Voice Dictation** - High productivity impact, moderate complexity
3. **Hanging Protocols** - Improves workflow efficiency, moderate complexity
4. **Critical Results Alert System** - Patient safety critical, low-medium complexity

Let me know which feature you'd like to add first!
