## 🚀 How to Test

### Quick Demo (Recommended)

1. Add demo route to `viewer/src/App.tsx`:
```tsx
import NewFeaturesDemo from './examples/NewFeaturesDemo'

<Route path="/demo/new-features" element={<NewFeaturesDemo />} />
```

2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/demo/new-features`

3. Test all three features in the tabs!

### Individual Testing

**Voice Dictation:**
- Click mic button → Speak → See text appear

**Comparison Viewer:**
- Select prior study → Toggle sync options → Compare

**Hanging Protocols:**
- Click layout button → Select protocol → See layout change
