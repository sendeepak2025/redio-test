# ✅ Frontend AI Integration - FIXED!

## What Was Wrong

The `AIAnalysisPanel` component was **hardcoded** to always show "Demo Mode Active" warning, even when the AI services were running.

It never actually checked if the services were available!

## What I Fixed

### 1. Added Health Check on Component Mount

```typescript
const [servicesAvailable, setServicesAvailable] = useState(false)
const [checkingHealth, setCheckingHealth] = useState(true)

useEffect(() => {
  checkServicesHealth()
}, [])

const checkServicesHealth = async () => {
  try {
    setCheckingHealth(true)
    const health = await medicalAIService.checkHealth()
    const available = health.services.medSigLIP.available || health.services.medGemma4B.available
    setServicesAvailable(available)
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Health check failed:', err)
    setServicesAvailable(false)
  } finally {
    setCheckingHealth(false)
  }
}
```

### 2. Updated UI to Show Actual Status

**Before Analysis**:
- ✅ Shows "Checking AI services..." while checking
- ✅ Shows "AI Services Available" if services are running
- ⚠️ Shows "Demo Mode Active" only if services are NOT running
- ✅ Button text changes: "Run AI Analysis" vs "Run Demo AI Analysis"

**After Analysis**:
- ✅ Shows "AI Services Active" banner if services are running
- ⚠️ Shows "Demo Mode" warning only if services are NOT running

## How to Test

### 1. Make Sure AI Services Are Running

```powershell
cd G:\RADIOLOGY\redio-test\ai-services

# Check if running
curl http://localhost:5001/health
curl http://localhost:5002/health

# If not running, start them
.\start-ai-services.bat
```

### 2. Restart Frontend (if running)

```powershell
cd G:\RADIOLOGY\redio-test\viewer

# If dev server is running, restart it
# Press Ctrl+C to stop, then:
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test in Browser

1. Open: http://localhost:5173
2. Login
3. Open a study in the viewer
4. Click "AI Analysis" tab
5. You should now see:
   - ✅ "AI Services Available" (green banner)
   - ✅ Button says "Run AI Analysis"
   - ✅ No demo mode warning

### 4. Click "Run AI Analysis"

You should see:
- ✅ Loading indicator
- ✅ Real AI results from your local services
- ✅ Classification from MedSigLIP
- ✅ Report from MedGemma
- ✅ "AI Services Active" banner (not demo mode)

## What You'll See Now

### Before (Wrong):
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ⚠️  Demo Mode Active                │
│ AI services not running             │
│                                     │
│ [Run Demo AI Analysis]              │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### After (Correct):
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ✅ AI Services Available            │
│ MedSigLIP and MedGemma ready        │
│                                     │
│ [Run AI Analysis]                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Health check added to component
- [x] Services status checked on mount
- [x] UI updated to show actual status
- [x] Button text changes based on availability
- [x] Demo warning only shows when services are down
- [x] Success banner shows when services are up
- [ ] Test in browser (your turn!)

## Next Steps

1. **Restart your frontend** (if it's running)
2. **Open the viewer** and go to AI Analysis tab
3. **You should see the green "AI Services Available" message**
4. **Click "Run AI Analysis"** to test

The frontend will now correctly detect that your AI services are running! 🎉
