  startIcon={<CompareArrowsIcon />}
  onClick={() => setShowComparison(true)}
>
  Compare with Prior
</Button>

// Option 2: In worklist context menu
<MenuItem onClick={() => openComparison(study)}>

- [ ] Implement `onProtocolApply` callback
- [ ] Configure viewport layout based on protocol
- [ ] Load series into correct viewports
- [ ] Test auto-apply feature

### Where to Add
```tsx
// In viewer toolbar (next to other tools)
<HangingProtocols
  currentModality={study.modality}
  currentBodyPart={study.bodyPart}
  onProtocolApply={(protocol) => {
    applyViewportLayout(protocol)
  }}
/>
```

### Implementation Details
- [ ] Parse protocol configuration
- [ ] Create viewport grid (rows √ó cols)
