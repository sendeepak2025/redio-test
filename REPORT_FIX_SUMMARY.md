# AI Report Fix Summary

## Problem
Downloaded AI Analysis Reports only contained header information (Analysis ID, Date, Study) but were missing all actual findings, metrics, and analysis data.

## Solution
Enhanced the PDF generation function in `server/src/services/ai-analysis-orchestrator.js` to include **ALL** analysis data.

## What's Now Included in Reports

### Single Slice Reports
1. ✅ Report metadata (ID, dates, status)
2. ✅ Complete study information (UIDs, modality, patient info)
3. ✅ AI models used
4. ✅ **Classification results** with confidence and top predictions
5. ✅ **Complete clinical findings** (full text)
6. ✅ **Complete impression** (full text)
7. ✅ **All recommendations** (numbered list)
8. ✅ **Combined analysis** (model agreement, overall confidence)
9. ✅ **Additional metrics** (if any)
10. ✅ **Complete raw JSON data** (separate page for transparency)
11. ✅ Footer with disclaimer

### Consolidated Multi-Slice Reports
1. ✅ Report metadata
2. ✅ **Summary statistics** (total slices, average confidence)
3. ✅ **Classification distribution** (e.g., "Normal: 15 slices, Abnormal: 5 slices")
4. ✅ **Per-slice results** - EVERY slice listed individually with:
   - Slice number
   - Classification
   - Confidence
   - Findings
5. ✅ No slices omitted
6. ✅ Failed slices clearly marked

## File Modified
- `server/src/services/ai-analysis-orchestrator.js`
  - Enhanced `generateReportPDF()` function
  - Added `generateConsolidatedPDF()` function

## Key Improvements
