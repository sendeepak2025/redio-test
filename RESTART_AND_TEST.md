# 🔄 RESTART BACKEND AND TEST

## IMPORTANT: Backend MUST be restarted!

Code change ho gaya hai but backend restart nahi hua toh purana code hi run ho raha hai.

## Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Stop Backend
Backend terminal mein:
```
Ctrl + C
```

### Step 2: Start Backend
```bash
cd server
npm start
```

Wait for:
```
✅ Connected to MongoDB
🚀 Server running on port 8001
```

### Step 3: Run Test (New Terminal)
```bash
cd server
node test-series-backend.js
```

## What to Look For

### Backend Terminal Should Show:
```
🎯 SERIES-SPECIFIC ROUTE HIT: { seriesUid: '...888' }
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[MIGRATION SERVICE] Frame request received
[MIGRATION SERVICE] Study UID: ...885
[MIGRATION SERVICE] Series UID: ...888
[MIGRATION SERVICE] Frame Index: 0
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🎯 Migration Service: Filtering by series ...888
📊 Migration Service: Found 2 instances
```

### Test Output Should Show:
```
✅ All series return DIFFERENT frames!
```

### If Still Same:

Check backend terminal logs:

**If you see:**
```
[MIGRATION SERVICE] Series UID: NOT PROVIDED
⚠️ Migration Service: NO series filter
📊 Migration Service: Found 266 instances
```

Then route is NOT passing seriesUid correctly!

**If you DON'T see any [MIGRATION SERVICE] logs:**

Then route is not being hit at all - check route order in `server/src/routes/index.js`

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Stop and restart backend
cd server
# Press Ctrl+C to stop
npm start

# Terminal 2 - Wait 5 seconds, then test
cd server
node test-series-backend.js
```

## Expected Final Output

```
📊 Result:
✅ All series return DIFFERENT frames!
```

With different hashes:
```
1. SCOUT:
   Hash: iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAgAAAAIACAAAAADRE4smAAAgAE...

2. Pre Contrast Chest:
   Hash: DIFFERENT_HASH_12345...

3. lung:
   Hash: ANOTHER_HASH_67890...
```

## If Still Not Working

Share:
1. Complete backend terminal output (all logs)
2. Test output
3. Screenshot of backend terminal

This will show exactly what's happening!
