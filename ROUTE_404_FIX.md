# ✅ 404 Error Fixed - Route Path Mismatch

## 🐛 Problem

```
POST http://localhost:8001/api/structured-reports/from-ai/... 404 (Not Found)
```

**Reason:** Route path mismatch!

- **Frontend calling:** `/api/structured-reports/...`
- **Backend registered:** `/api/reports/...`

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Updated: `server/src/routes/index.js`

**Before:**
```javascript
router.use('/api/reports', structuredReportsRoutes);
```

**After:**
```javascript
router.use('/api/structured-reports', structuredReportsRoutes);
```

---

## 🚀 Apply Fix

### Step 1: Restart Backend
```bash
cd server
npm start
```

### Step 2: Test Route
```bash
# Test if route exists
curl http://localhost:8001/api/structured-reports/study/test

# Should return 401 (Unauthorized) instead of 404
# 401 means route exists but needs authentication ✅
```

### Step 3: Test in Frontend
1. Open frontend: `http://localhost:3010`
2. Run AI analysis
3. Click "Create Medical Report"
4. **Should work now!** ✅

---

## 🔍 Route Registration

Now the complete route path is:

```
Base: /api/structured-reports
Routes:
  POST   /api/structured-reports/from-ai/:analysisId
  PUT    /api/structured-reports/:reportId
  POST   /api/structured-reports/:reportId/sign
  GET    /api/structured-reports/study/:studyInstanceUID
  GET    /api/structured-reports/:reportId
  GET    /api/structured-reports/:reportId/pdf
```

---

## 🧪 Verification

### Check 1: Server Logs
```bash
# After restart, you should see:
✅ Server running on port 8001
✅ MongoDB connected
✅ Routes loaded
```

### Check 2: Test Route
```bash
curl http://localhost:8001/api/structured-reports/study/test \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer test"

# Should return 401 or 404 with proper error message
# NOT "Cannot GET /api/structured-reports/..."
```

### Check 3: Frontend Test
```
Browser Console:
✅ POST http://localhost:8001/api/structured-reports/from-ai/... 200 OK
✅ No 404 errors
✅ Report created successfully
```

---

## 📊 Error Progression

### Error 1: CORS (Fixed ✅)
```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin error
→ Fixed by adding proper CORS config
```

### Error 2: CORS Headers (Fixed ✅)
```
x-correlation-id not allowed
→ Fixed by adding header to allowedHeaders
```

### Error 3: 404 Not Found (Fixed ✅)
```
Route not found
→ Fixed by changing /api/reports to /api/structured-reports
```

### Next: Should Work! 🎉
```
✅ CORS configured
✅ Headers allowed
✅ Route registered
✅ Ready to create reports!
```

## 🎯 Summary

**What Was Wrong:**
- Route registered at `/api/reports`
- Frontend calling `/api/structured-reports`
- Mismatch = 404 error

**What Was Fixed:**
- Changed route to `/api/structured-reports`
- Now matches frontend calls
- Should work perfectly!

**Next Steps:**
1. ✅ Restart backend
2. ✅ Test route exists
3. ✅ Test report creation
4. ✅ Celebrate! 🎉

## 🐛 If Still 404

### Check 1: Route File Exists?
```bash
ls server/src/routes/structured-reports.js
# Should exist
```

### Check 2: Route Imported?
```bash
grep "structured-reports" server/src/routes/index.js
# Should show: const structuredReportsRoutes = require('./structured-reports');
```

### Check 3: Route Registered?
```bash
grep "api/structured-reports" server/src/routes/index.js
# Should show: router.use('/api/structured-reports', structuredReportsRoutes);
```

### Check 4: Server Restarted?
```bash
# Make sure you restarted after changes
cd server
npm start
```

---

## 🎉 Done!

Ab 404 error nahi aana chahiye. Backend restart karo aur test karo! 🚀

**Expected Result:**
```
✅ POST /api/structured-reports/from-ai/... 200 OK
✅ Report created successfully
✅ Report Editor shows draft report
✅ Can edit and sign report
```

Test karo aur batao! 😊
