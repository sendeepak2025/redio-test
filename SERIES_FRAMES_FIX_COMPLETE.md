# ‚úÖ Series-Specific Frame Display - COMPLETE FIX

## Problem Identified

Console logs showed:
```
Series UID: ...888
Total Frames: 1    ‚Üê Wrong!
Total Frames: 266  ‚Üê Wrong!
Total Frames: 2    ‚Üê Correct!
```

**Root Cause:** Race condition - `totalFrames` was initialized to `1`, then updated later, causing frame URLs to be generated with wrong count.

## Solution Applied

### File: `viewer/src/components/viewer/MedicalImageViewer.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
const [totalFrames, setTotalFrames] = useState(1) // Wrong - always starts at 1
```

**After:**
```typescript
const [totalFrames, setTotalFrames] = useState(sopInstanceUIDs?.length || 1)
// Correct - initializes with actual series frame count
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Component Mount:**
   - `totalFrames` = `sopInstanceUIDs.length` (correct from start!)
   - Frame URLs generated with correct count
   - No race condition

2. **Series Switch:**
   - Component re-mounts with new `sopInstanceUIDs`
   - `totalFrames` = new series frame count
   - Frame URLs regenerated with correct count

## Expected Behavior

### Series 1 (SCOUT):
```
[SERIES IDENTIFIER] Series UID: ...888
[SERIES IDENTIFIER] Total Frames: 2  ‚Üê Correct from start!
```

### Series 2 (Pre Contrast Chest):
```
[SERIES IDENTIFIER] Series UID: ...893
[SERIES IDENTIFIER] Total Frames: 132  ‚Üê Correct from start!
```

### Series 3 (lung):
```
[SERIES IDENTIFIER] Series UID: ...893.3
[SERIES IDENTIFIER] Total Frames: 132  ‚Üê Correct from start!
```

## Testing

### Step 1: Restart Frontend
```bash
cd viewer
npm start
```

### Step 2: Open Viewer
```
http://localhost:3000/viewer/1.2.840.113619.2.482.3.2831195393.851.1709524269.885
```

### Step 3: Check Console (F12)
Click Series 1, 2, 3 and verify:
- ‚úÖ Total Frames is correct from the first log
- ‚úÖ No jumping between 1, 266, and correct value
- ‚úÖ Series UID changes correctly
- ‚úÖ Frame URLs include correct series UID

### Step 4: Verify Images
- ‚úÖ Series 1: Shows 2 SCOUT images
- ‚úÖ Series 2: Shows 132 Pre Contrast Chest images
- ‚úÖ Series 3: Shows 132 lung images
- ‚úÖ Each series shows DIFFERENT images

## Backend Verification

If you still see same images, check backend terminal for:
```
[SERIES IDENTIFIER - BACKEND] Frame request received
[SERIES IDENTIFIER - BACKEND] Series UID: ...
[SERIES IDENTIFIER - BACKEND] Found instances: X
```

If backend logs don't appear, the issue is in routing. Share backend logs for further debugging.

## Files Modified

1. ‚úÖ `viewer/src/components/viewer/MedicalImageViewer.tsx` - Fixed totalFrames initialization
2. ‚úÖ `server/src/routes/index.js` - Added series-specific route
3. ‚úÖ `server/src/controllers/orthancInstanceController.js` - Added series filtering
4. ‚úÖ `viewer/src/services/ApiService.ts` - Added seriesUID parameter
5. ‚úÖ `viewer/src/pages/orthanc/ViewerPage.tsx` - Pass seriesUID to viewer

## Status: READY TO TEST üöÄ

The race condition is fixed. Frame count will be correct from the start, no more jumping values!
