```

1. Open viewer
2. Navigate to this study
3. Click **"RUN AI ANALYSIS"**
4. Note the results:
   - Number of findings: _____
   - Finding types: _____
   - Report ID: _____

### 2. Test Study 2
```
Study UID: 3.12.2.1107.5.4.3.123456789012345.19950922.121803.6
```

1. Navigate to this study
2. Click **"RUN AI ANALYSIS"**
3. Note the results:
   - Number of findings: _____
   - Finding types: _____
   - Report ID: _____

### 3. Compare Results

The two studies should have:
- ‚úÖ Different number of findings (0-3 random)
- ‚úÖ Different types of findings
- ‚úÖ Different confidence scores
- ‚úÖ Different bounding box positions
- ‚úÖ Different report IDs
- ‚úÖ Correct study UIDs

## What You Should See

### Example Study 1 Result:
```
Report ID: RPT-1.3.12.2-1729600000000
Study UID: 1.3.12.2.1107.5.4.3.4975316777216.19951114.94101.161

Findings (2):
1. Consolidation - 78% confidence - MEDIUM severity
   Location: (0.35, 0.45)
   
2. Pulmonary Nodule - 82% confidence - MEDIUM severity
   Location: (0.58, 0.32)
```

### Example Study 2 Result:
```
Report ID: RPT-3.12.2.1-1729600100000
Study UID: 3.12.2.1107.5.4.3.123456789012345.19950922.121803.6

Findings (1):
1. Cardiomegaly - 71% confidence - LOW severity
   Location: (0.42, 0.48)
```

## Browser Console Logs

Open browser DevTools (F12) and check console for:

```
üîò performAnalysis called { studyInstanceUID: "...", frameIndex: 0 }
üîç Starting AI analysis...
‚úÖ AI analysis complete: { studyInstanceUID: "...", reportId: "...", detections: [...] }
```

## Backend Server Logs

Check terminal for:

```
üìã Generating comprehensive AI report for study: 1.3.12.2...
üîç Detecting abnormalities...
‚úÖ Generated 2 mock detections for XR
‚úÖ AI analysis complete for study: 1.3.12.2...
```

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Study 1 generates a report
- [ ] Study 2 generates a different report
- [ ] Each report has correct study UID
- [ ] Each report has unique report ID
- [ ] Findings vary between studies
- [ ] Confidence scores are different
- [ ] Bounding boxes are in different positions
- [ ] Image snapshots are included (if available)
- [ ] Detection summary shows correct counts
- [ ] Reports can be downloaded as PDF

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Frame not found"
**Solution:** The study needs to have frames cached. Try viewing the study first, then run analysis.

### Issue: Same findings for all studies
**Solution:** Clear browser cache and refresh. Server should be restarted.

### Issue: No detections shown
**Solution:** Check if `detections` array is empty (normal study) or if there's an error in console.

### Issue: Report not saving
**Solution:** Check server logs for file system permissions. Reports save to `server/backend/ai_reports/`

## Expected Behavior

### Normal Study (No Findings)
```
‚úÖ No abnormalities detected (normal study)
Detections: 0
```

### Study with Findings
```
üîç Detections Found: 2

Detection 1:
  - Type: consolidation
  - Confidence: 78.5%
  - Severity: MEDIUM
  
Detection 2:
  - Type: nodule
  - Confidence: 82.1%
  - Severity: MEDIUM
```

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ Each study generates unique findings
‚úÖ Study UIDs are correctly displayed
‚úÖ Report IDs are unique per study
‚úÖ Detections include bounding boxes
‚úÖ Image snapshots are included
‚úÖ Reports can be exported

## Demo Mode Notice

Currently running in **Demo Mode** with mock data. The findings are realistic but randomly generated. To enable real AI analysis, start the AI services (see AI-ANALYSIS-STATUS-AND-ACTIVATION.md).
