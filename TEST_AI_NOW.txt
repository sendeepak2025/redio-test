🎉 WHAT WAS FIXED:

The "Failed to fetch" error was caused by CORS (Cross-Origin 
Resource Sharing) blocking your browser from accessing the AI 
services.

✅ Added flask-cors to both AI services
✅ Restarted services with CORS enabled
✅ Ready to test!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🚀 TEST RIGHT NOW:

1. REFRESH YOUR BROWSER
   Press: Ctrl+R or F5

2. OPEN A STUDY
   Go to viewer and load any study

3. CLICK AI ASSISTANT
   Click the robot icon (🤖)

4. CLICK "ANALYZE CURRENT FRAME"
   Should work immediately!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ SERVICES STATUS:

MedSigLIP:  ✅ Running on port 5001 (CORS enabled)
MedGemma:   ✅ Running on port 5002 (CORS enabled)

Test:
  curl http://localhost:5001/health
  curl http://localhost:5002/health

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 WHAT YOU'LL SEE:

Instead of:
  ❌ AI analysis failed: Failed to fetch

You'll see:
  ✅ AI Classification Complete!
  Result: normal
  Confidence: 85%

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📝 WHAT CHANGED:

Before:
  Browser → AI Service
  ❌ BLOCKED by CORS

After:
  Browser → AI Service
  ✅ ALLOWED with CORS headers

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎉 IT SHOULD WORK NOW!

Just refresh your browser and try clicking 
"Analyze Current Frame" again!
