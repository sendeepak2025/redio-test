## 🧪 Testing Steps

### Step 1: Access the Application
1. Open your browser
2. Navigate to the preview URL
3. Login with your credentials

### Step 2: Navigate to Upload
1. Go to **Patients** page
2. Click **"Upload Study"** button
3. Upload dialog should open

### Step 3: Select DICOM Files
**Important**: Make sure your files are:
- Valid DICOM format (.dcm extension)
- Not compressed/zipped
- Medical imaging files (CT, MRI, X-Ray, etc.)

### Step 4: Upload

2. Select one or more DICOM files
3. Click "Upload" button

### Step 5: Monitor Upload
Watch for:
- ✅ Upload progress
- ✅ Success message
- ✅ Study UID displayed
- ✅ Automatic redirect to viewer

## 📊 What to Check

### Frontend Console (Browser DevTools)
Look for these log messages:
```
📤 Uploading PACS study: 
   fileCount: X
   files: [array of file details]
   totalSize: XXXXX

📥 PACS upload response:
   success: true
   data: {...}
```

### Backend Logs
```bash
tail -f /var/log/supervisor/backend.out.log
```

Look for:
```
✅ Accepting file: filename.dcm (application/dicom)
📥 Received upload request: {...}
📤 Processing PACS upload: {...}
✅ PACS upload successful: {...}
```

## ❌ If Upload Fails

### Error: "No DICOM file provided"
**Cause**: File didn't reach backend
**Fix**: 
- Check file is selected
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify network request was sent

### Error: "File type not supported"
**Cause**: File doesn't have .dcm extension or valid MIME type
**Fix**:
- Rename file to add .dcm extension
- Verify it's actually a DICOM file
- Try with different DICOM file

### Error: "Orthanc upload failed"
**Cause**: File is not valid DICOM format
**Fix**:
- Verify file opens in DICOM viewer
- Try with known good DICOM file
- Check if file is corrupted

### Error: "401 Unauthorized"
**Cause**: Not logged in or session expired
**Fix**:
- Refresh page and login again
- Check if token is valid

## 🔍 Enhanced Debugging

### Backend now logs:
1. **File Reception**:
   - Has file: yes/no
   - Field name: 'dicom'
   - File details

2. **File Processing**:
   - Filename
   - Size in MB
   - MIME type
   - Buffer length

3. **Upload Result**:
   - Study UID
   - Frame count
   - Success/failure

### Frontend now logs:
1. **Before Upload**:
   - File count
   - File names, sizes, types
   - Total size

2. **After Upload**:
   - Full response
   - Success/error details

## 📝 Example Success Flow

```
[Frontend Console]
📤 Uploading PACS study:
   fileCount: 1
   files: [{ name: 'CT-CHEST-001.dcm', size: 1702398, type: 'application/dicom' }]
   totalSize: 1702398

[Backend Log]
✅ Accepting file: CT-CHEST-001.dcm (application/dicom)
📥 Received upload request: { hasFile: true }
📤 Processing PACS upload: {
  filename: 'CT-CHEST-001.dcm',
  size: '1.62 MB',
  mimetype: 'application/dicom',
  bufferLength: 1702398
}
Starting PACS upload and processing for file: CT-CHEST-001.dcm
Uploading CT-CHEST-001.dcm to Orthanc PACS (1702398 bytes)...
Successfully uploaded to Orthanc: { instanceId: 'xxx', studyId: 'yyy' }
✅ PACS upload successful: { studyUID: '1.2.3.4.5...', frames: 1 }

[Frontend Console]
📥 PACS upload response: {
  success: true,
  message: 'Successfully uploaded and processed...',
  data: {
    studyInstanceUID: '1.2.3.4.5...',
    totalFrames: 1,
    readyForViewing: true
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Test Cases

### Test 1: Single DICOM File
- [  ] Upload 1 .dcm file
- [  ] Verify success message
- [  ] Check study appears in list
- [  ] Click to view study

### Test 2: Multiple DICOM Files
- [  ] Upload 2-3 .dcm files
- [  ] Verify all files processed
- [  ] Check study created
- [  ] Verify frame count

### Test 3: Large File
- [  ] Upload file > 10MB
- [  ] Watch upload progress
- [  ] Verify successful upload
- [  ] Check viewing works

### Test 4: Invalid File
- [  ] Try uploading .jpg or .pdf
- [  ] Should get clear error message
- [  ] Error should explain file type issue

## 🚀 Quick Test Command

To verify backend is accepting files:
```bash
# Get a test DICOM from Orthanc
curl -u orthanc:orthanc_secure_2024 \
  http://69.62.70.102:8042/instances/93816070-2dd6549b-90905ff2-5cbde0d2-8d8617c9/file \
  -o /tmp/test.dcm

# Check file size
ls -lh /tmp/test.dcm
# Should show: -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1.6M
```
