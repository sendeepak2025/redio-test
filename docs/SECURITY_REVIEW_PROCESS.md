# Security Review Process

## Overview

This document outlines the security review process for the Orthanc Bridge Production Hardening project. All changes that affect security-sensitive components must undergo a thorough security review before being merged.

## When Security Review is Required

Security review is **mandatory** for changes to:

### High Impact Changes (Require Security Team Lead Approval)
- Authentication and authorization systems
- Cryptographic implementations
- Secret management and storage
- Network security configurations (TLS, certificates, firewalls)
- Container and infrastructure security
- CI/CD pipeline security
- Webhook signature validation
- PHI data handling and anonymization

### Medium Impact Changes (Require Security Team Approval)
- Configuration file changes
- Database schema modifications
- API endpoint additions or modifications
- Logging and monitoring changes
- Third-party dependency updates
- Environment variable changes

### Low Impact Changes (Standard Code Review)
- UI/UX changes that don't affect security
- Documentation updates
- Non-security related bug fixes
- Performance optimizations (without security implications)

## Security Review Process

### 1. Automated Security Scanning

Before manual review, all PRs undergo automated security scanning:

- **Dependency Vulnerability Scanning** - Snyk scans for known vulnerabilities
- **Container Security Scanning** - Docker image vulnerability assessment
- **Static Code Analysis** - Code quality and security pattern analysis
- **Secret Detection** - Automated detection of hardcoded secrets
- **License Compliance** - Verification of acceptable licenses

### 2. Security Impact Analysis

The system automatically analyzes changed files and categorizes security impact:

- **High Impact** - Critical security components
- **Medium Impact** - Security-adjacent components
- **Low Impact** - Minimal security implications

### 3. Security Review Assignment

Based on impact level, appropriate reviewers are assigned:

- **High Impact** - Security Team Lead + DevOps Team Lead
- **Medium Impact** - Security Team Member + DevOps Team Member
- **Low Impact** - Standard code review process

### 4. Manual Security Review

Reviewers use the Security Review Template to evaluate:

- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Data protection and privacy controls
- Input validation and injection prevention
- Network and infrastructure security
- Logging and monitoring adequacy
- Error handling and information disclosure
- Compliance and regulatory requirements

### 5. Risk Assessment

Each review includes a risk assessment:

- **Risk Identification** - Potential security risks
- **Severity Rating** - Impact if exploited
- **Likelihood Assessment** - Probability of exploitation
- **Mitigation Strategies** - How to address risks

### 6. Approval Decision

Reviewers make one of four decisions:

- **APPROVED** - No security concerns
- **APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS** - Minor issues to address
- **REQUIRES CHANGES** - Significant issues must be resolved
- **REJECTED** - Critical flaws prevent approval

### 7. Documentation and Tracking

All security reviews are documented and tracked:

- Security review templates are completed
- Approval tracking issues are created
- Review artifacts are stored for audit purposes
- Follow-up actions are tracked to completion

## Security Review Checklist

## Emergency Security Reviews

For critical security vulnerabilities or production incidents:

### Fast-Track Process
1. **Immediate Assessment** - Security team lead reviews within 2 hours
2. **Risk Evaluation** - Assess immediate threat and impact
3. **Emergency Approval** - Can bypass normal process if justified
4. **Post-Incident Review** - Full review within 24 hours of deployment

### Emergency Approval Criteria
- Critical security vulnerability with active exploitation
- Production system compromise requiring immediate remediation
- Regulatory compliance deadline with legal implications
- Patient safety or data breach prevention

### Emergency Documentation Requirements
- Incident description and timeline
- Risk assessment and justification for emergency process
- Remediation steps taken
- Post-incident review findings
- Process improvements identified

## Compliance and Audit Requirements
