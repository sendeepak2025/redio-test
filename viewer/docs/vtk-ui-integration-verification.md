- [ ] Verify all controls work

#### Test 11.4: Edge
- [ ] Run all tests on Edge 90+

- [ ] Verify all controls work

## Known Issues / Expected Behavior

1. **Adaptive Quality**: During interaction, quality automatically reduces for better performance. This is expected behavior.

2. **FPS Variation**: FPS will vary based on:
   - Volume size
   - Quality setting
   - Render mode
   - GPU capabilities

3. **Canvas Fallback Performance**: Canvas renderer will be significantly slower than VTK.js. This is expected.

4. **GPU Memory**: Large volumes may use significant GPU memory. Monitor the GPU memory indicator.

## Reporting Issues

When reporting issues, please include:
- Browser name and version
- Operating system
- Volume size (dimensions and number of frames)
- Renderer type (VTK.js or Canvas)
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Screenshots or screen recordings (if applicable)
- Console errors (if any)

## Success Criteria

All tests should pass with:
- ✅ All controls respond correctly
- ✅ Visual feedback is clear and immediate
- ✅ Performance is acceptable (30+ FPS for VTK.js, 5-15 FPS for Canvas)
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Fallback works correctly when WebGL is unavailable
- ✅ All browsers show consistent behavior

## Notes

- This checklist should be completed before marking task 8.4 as complete
- Any failing tests should be documented and fixed before proceeding
- Performance benchmarks should be recorded for future reference
